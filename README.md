This repository is a collection of my learnings and experiments while transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript.
Think of it as a practical guide that documents common pitfalls, key differences, and best practices when moving to TypeScript.

# 🚀 Why TypeScript?

JavaScript is flexible but can get messy with type errors, unexpected bugs, and unclear function contracts.
1. Static typing → Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime.
2. Better tooling → Autocomplete, refactoring, and IntelliSense support.
3. Safer code → Explicit type declarations reduce hidden bugs.
4. Scalable design → Great for large projects and teams.
