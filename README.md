A collection of notes, examples, and experiments from my transition from JavaScript to TypeScript.  
This repo documents core concepts, common pitfalls, and practical use cases — serving as both my learning log and a quick reference for anyone starting with TypeScript.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- **Basics**: variables, types, enums, tuples, unions, type aliases  
- **Functions**: typing, better practices, handling `any`  
- **Objects & Interfaces**: readonly, optional fields, differences between `type` and `interface`  
- **Advanced**: generics, abstract classes, discriminated unions, exhaustive checking with `never`  
- **Design**: type narrowing, protected members, scalable code patterns

## 🚀 Why TypeScript?
- Catch errors at **compile time** instead of runtime  
- Stronger **tooling support** (IntelliSense, refactoring, autocomplete)  
- **Safer, more predictable code** with explicit types  
- Scales well for **larger projects and teams**
